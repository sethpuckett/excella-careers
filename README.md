##Development Setup
Xamarin development requires [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx "Visual Studio Download") on Windows (Community Edition is sufficient) or [Xamarin Studio](https://www.xamarin.com/download "Xamarin Studio Download") on MacOS. Detailed installation instructions can be found on the [Xamarin website](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/getting_started/installation/ "Xamarin Installation"). Android development, testing, and deployment can be done from Windows or Mac. iOS development can be done from Windows or Mac, but testing and deployment require a Mac running [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12 "Xcode Download"). When an Xamarin.iOS application is opened in Visual Studio the user should be prompted to connect to a Mac on the network, but in case of difficulties detailed instructions can be found [here](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/getting_started/installation/windows/connecting-to-mac/ "Connecting to the Mac").

##Testing on a Device
Visual Studio and Xamarin Studio offer iOS and Android emulators, but eventually you will want to test on an actual device. Setup for [Android device testing](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/deployment,_testing,_and_metrics/debug-on-device/ "Debug on an Android Device") and [iOS device testing](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/getting_started/installation/device_provisioning/ "iOS Device Provisioning") can be found on the Xamarin website.
